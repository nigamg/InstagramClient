This is an Android demo application for mimicing the Instagram app using Instagram API. 

Time spent: 8 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:


    Required: User can scroll through current popular photos from Instagram
    Required: Graphic, Caption, Username
    Optional: relative timestamp, like count, user profile image
    Optional: Add pull-to-refresh for popular stream with SwipeRefreshLayout
    Optional: Show latest comment for each photo
        Tip: Latest comment is dispaled as commenter_name:comment, along with total number of comments showen inlined with likes count.
    Optional: Display each user profile image using a RoundedImageView
        Issue: RoundImageView are by-default showing black border, tried multiple option will no luck. 
    Option: Apply the popular Butterknife annotation library to reduce view boilerplate.


Notes:

Most of the resolution to issues, I found under hints given under assignments. Very helpful
